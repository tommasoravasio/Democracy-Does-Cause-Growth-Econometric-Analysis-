# Democracy-Does-Cause-Growth-Econometric-Analysis-

This repository contains a summary and analysis of “Democracy Does Cause Growth” by Acemoglu et al. (2019), conducted as a project in my Econometrics class in Bocconi.

We analyzed and summarized the key methodologies, findings, and implications of the paper. Specifically, we:
	•	Explored the econometric strategies used in the paper, including dynamic panel models, semiparametric treatment effects, and instrumental variable techniques.
	•	Synthesized the results to highlight the mechanisms through which democracy impacts GDP growth.
	•	Evaluated the robustness of the original findings.
The project aimed to make the complex analysis of the original paper accessible and comprehensible, while reinforcing our understanding of advanced econometric methods.
